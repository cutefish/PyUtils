A docker management tool

https://docs.docker.com/installation/.

(2) Add user to docker group to avoid root privilege.
sudo usermod -aG docker <user>

(3) Set-up proxy and oracle dns for docker
Add 'DOCKER_OPTS="--dns 10.209.76.198 --dns 10.209.76.197"'
Add 'export http_proxy="http://www-proxy.us.oracle.com:80/"' in /etc/default/docker

* Use the tool

To run an execution, users write a configuration xml file and some scripts to
run on containers. The configuration file specifies the work flow of the
execution. Each execution includes tasks such as building image, launching
groups of containers and executing commands on groups of containers. Tasks can
have dependency such that a task will not run before all tasks that it depends
on finish. See the example directory for the examples.

To run:
python main.py <config xml file>
